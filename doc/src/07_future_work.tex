\section{Future Work and Research Directions}
\subsection{Symbolic Partial Order Reductions}
Combine $\tau$-closure with stubborn set or ample set selection using clock dependency analysis to prune interleavings.

\subsection{Parametric Timed Bisimulation}
Generalize guards with parameters; integrate parametric DBM (PDBM) constraints; solve via SMT-backed refinement.

\subsection{Compositional Reasoning}
Introduce interface zones per component, compose via synchronized product with assume/guarantee contracts.

\subsection{On-the-fly Abstraction}
Derive LU-bounds dynamically from frontier zones; feed back tightened bounds to extrapolation to curb blow-up.

\subsection{Counterexample-Guided Refinement}
If relation collapses to empty, extract mismatching pair path to refine partition or introduce clock splitting.

\subsection{Parallel Exploration}
Sharding of waiting list by location hash; lock-free insertion into state map with per-bucket spinlocks.

\subsection{Probabilistic Extensions}
Annotate transitions with rates/probabilities; lift RTWBS to weak probabilistic bisimulation using coupling arguments.
